# Guidance on how to contribute

> All contributions to this project will be released under the included MIT license. By submitting a pull request or filing a bug, issue, or feature request, you are agreeing to comply with the license and to release your contribution under it.

There are three main ways to contribute to this project:

1. File a bug, issue, or feature request in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/alchemyrpg/ddb2alchemy/issues/new).
2. Participate in [discussions](https://github.com/alchemyrpg/ddb2alchemy/discussions) on GitHub.
3. Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/alchemyrpg/ddb2alchemy/compare) to change the codebase.

## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, or find ways to contribute. Find a bug or feature, mention in the issue that you'd like to take on that effort, then follow the steps below to submit a pull request.

## Changing the codebase

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your own fork, and then submit a pull request. At minimum, please include a link to a D&D Beyond character that can be used to validate the changes. Updating any applicable tests or creating new tests is also appreciated.

We use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format the codebase. Please run `yarn format` before submitting a pull request; otherwise the automated tests will fail. This helps ensure that the code is consistently formatted and easy to read.

Once your pull request has been submitted, a project maintainer will review it and provide feedback. If the changes are approved, the pull request will be merged into the codebase. Eventually, the changes will be published in a new version of the library and pulled into an Alchemy release by Alchemy staff.
