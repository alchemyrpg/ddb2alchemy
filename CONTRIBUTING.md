## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, or find ways to contribute. Find a bug or feature, mention in the issue that you'd like to take on that effort, then follow the steps below to submit a pull request.

## Changing the codebase
Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your own fork, and then submit a pull request. At minimum, please include a link to a D&D Beyond character that can be used to validate the changes. Updating any applicable tests or creating new tests is also appreciated.

Once your pull request has been submitted, a project maintainer will review it and provide feedback. If the changes are approved, the pull request will be merged into the codebase. Eventually, the changes will be published in a new version of the library and pulled into an Alchemy release by Alchemy staff.
